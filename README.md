# CIDR
CIDR Conversion to subnet using mask. Showing Network address, available host addresses and network address

# Notes
This is a study project where simple commands are used to achive a goal to find out CIDR Network, broadcast and host address along with ranges etc.
This first copy of the code can handle ONLY /16 and above. 
We are working on updating the code to handle /1 to /8 subnet masks as well but it is not there yet.

Use this code to study and learn coding especially 'Python'

You can copy/paste the code and use it as you feel fit.

# How to use

Give out a CIDR with Subnet mask
e.g. 192.168.0.1/24

It will display all the information along with how it is calculated

If you like the code, Would appreciate a word of confidence
Happy programming ......
